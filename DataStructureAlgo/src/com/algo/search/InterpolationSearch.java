/**
 * @author suryaverma The Interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary
 *         Search for instances, where the values in a sorted array are
 *         uniformly distributed. Binary Search always goes to middle element to
 *         check. On the other hand interpolation search may go to different
 *         locations according the value of key being searched. For example if
 *         the value of key is closer to the last element, interpolation search
 *         is likely to start search toward the end side.
